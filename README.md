Use of Ipconfig/IP address fixing/Logging administratively into router

Accessed command line by pressing start button and typing cmd
Use Ipconfig
I then found the IP address of the router which is next to the default gateway field
I typed 192.168.1.1 into my browser
was routed to https://www.cleancss.com/router-default/192.168.1.1
logged onto router by giving password which logged me into the manufacturer 
I selected connectivity, DHCP was enabled

I then verified if it was working on my laptop
-ipconfig/all
DHCP range shows 50 devices can connect at once
I then reserved my host IP address by going to DHCP reservations

I understand more of how to enable DHCP on my router, how to set IP addresses, how to administratively login to my router.
